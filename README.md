# pyFlashCards
Simple command line Python script to create and use flash cards.

# Notes
-This is one of the first Python scripts I made.  
-The primary goal was to learn how to use a few basic language functions (reading/writing files, user input, input manipulation, command line flags, etc.).  
-It allows the creation of flash cards through the console.  
-It also allows quizzing and will remove questions from the pool when any given question is correctly answered 3 times.
